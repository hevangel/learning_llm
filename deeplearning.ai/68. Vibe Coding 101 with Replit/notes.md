# 5 Skills for Vibe Coding 101
- Thinking
- Frameworks
- Checkpoints
- Debugging
- Context

## Thinking
- **Logical**
  - What is the same?
- **Analytical**
  - How do I play the game?
- **Computational**
  - What are the patterns behind the game?
- **Procedural**
  - How do I excel at the game?

## Frameworks
- You don't know what you don't know
- How do I do the things I want to?
- What frameworks:
  - ...allow me to do those things?
  - ...work best with LLMs?

## Checkpoints / Versions
- Things break â€” this is fact
- You should use version control (or checkpoints in Replit) to minimize this
- We'll chunk up our builds and move quickly

## Debugging
- It's actually a bit boring
- But you can make anything fun!
- The best debugging is methodical and thorough
- Goals:
  - Understand how your app works
  - Understand where the error is
  - How can you get to the root?
  - How can you tell the LLM what's wrong?

## Context
- Context window: the amount of tokens an LLM can process at a given time
- Context can be the prompt we provide to the LLM, but it can also be other things:
  - Images
  - Documentation
  - Errors
  - Details about your app / environment / preferences (!)
- Because LLMs might have outdated training data (or lack details of our implementation),
  we need to provide additional context.
- Think about it like working with a baker to make cake for your girlfriend / boyfriend

## Development Workflow
1. MVP or feature
2. Test
3. Error
4. Debug
5. Checkpoint
